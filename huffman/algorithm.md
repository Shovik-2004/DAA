1. Start with a list of characters and their frequencies.
2. Create a priority queue (min heap) to store nodes.
3. For each character and its frequency, create a leaf node and add it to the priority queue.
4. While there is more than one node in the priority queue:
   a. Remove the two nodes with the lowest frequency from the priority queue.
   b. Create a new internal node with these two nodes as children. The frequency of the new node is the sum of the frequencies of the children.
   c. Add the new internal node to the priority queue.
5. The remaining node in the priority queue is the root of the Huffman tree.
6. Traverse the Huffman tree to generate Huffman codes:
   a. Start from the root and traverse left for '0' and right for '1'.
   b. Assign codes to each leaf node by concatenating the path from the root to that node.
7. Encode the input data using the generated Huffman codes.
8. Decode the encoded data using the Huffman tree.
